		<h1 align="center">HTML Lesson 1</h1>
		
		
		<p>To start off with write the tag "html" which will start the webpage and lets the browser know what language it is in. </p>
		<p>Then to write a sentence, start with the tag "p", which stands for paragraph</p>
		
		<br/>
		
		<h3>Common Tags</h3>
			<p>In HTML there are a few tags that are essential to know. With all these you are required to add "&lt;(tag)&gt;". To close any tag add a "&lt;/(tag)&gt;".</p>
			
			<p>The most essential tag is the "html" tag, which you use to open all html files. You put the opening one at the start and the closing one at the end.</p>
			
			<p>"head" is also an important tag as you put your title of your webpage and metadata (a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.) in it. </p>
			
			<p>"body" is where you put headers, text, images, videos etc.</p>
			
			<p>"h" is short for header, it is basically a title, subheader, whatever you wish to call it. You put h and then a number between 1 and 6. The number represents the type of header, is the largest and boldest, 6 is the smallest and weakest. </p>
			
			<h1>1</h1>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<h3>3</h3>
			<h4>4</h4>
			<h5>5</h5>
			<h6>6</h6>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>"p", short for paragraph, is used for ordinary text. It is what we use for what we are typing right now! It is probably the most common tag</p>
			
			<p>"br/" is for putting a break in anything, you can use it to put a break between anything, or start a new <br/> line like i just did</p>
			
		<h3>Images</h3>
			<p>To inbed a photo in your web page just use the code "&lt;img src="learning_html.jpg" alt="Learning HTML"&gt;". Where it says src="learning_html.jpg" that is where you put the name of the image or the URL of the image. alt="Learning HTML" is what you wish to name the image.</p>
			
			<p>If you wish to control the height and width of the image to adjust the size, use the code "&lt;img src="html.png" alt="HTML 5 Logo" style="height:640px; width:800px;"&gt;". You can make the dimensions whatever you wish.</p>
			
		<h3>Tables</h3>
			<p>To create a table you need 4 main tags. "&lt;table&gt;" "&lt;tr&gt;" "&lt;th&gt;" "&lt;td&gt;"</p>
			
			<p>"&lt;table&gt;" is what you use to start off the table. It tells the browser that the code following is to be put in a table.</p>
			
			<p>"&lt;tr&gt;" is the row, use this to create a row</p>
			
			<p>"&lt;th&gt;" is the table column header</p>
			
			<p>"&lt;td&gt;" is what is in the cell, the data held inside the cell. Note that they can contain all sorts of HTML elements such as text, images, lists, other tables, etc.</p>
			
			<img src="Table.png" alt="Table set out">
			
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
		<h3>Validation</h3>
			<p>Validation is where a program runs through your code making sure it is all perfect, it detects any issues and tells you where it is and what is wrong with it. Although most of the errors wont actually affect the outcome of the code it just makes it all proper and correct and perfect</p>
			
			<p>To validate a website to XHTML you must put this at the very top of your code</p>
			
			<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;</p>
			
			<p>The website we use to validate is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">here</a></p>
			
			<p>Just put the url in the slot and it will check it</p>
			
		<h3>Connecting Multiple Pages</h3>
			<p>To connect multiple webpages use "&lt;a href="html.html"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;" replace "html.html" with the file name</p>
			
		<h3>File Organisation</h3>
